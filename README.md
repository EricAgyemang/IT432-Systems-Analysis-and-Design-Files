# Iteration 1: Domain Model Class Diagram
In this lab you practice create a first draft of domain model class diagram.
A domain model class diagram shows things that your system will track of in order to function.

You start by accessing: [AI](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai)
Pick Semantis or any other experiment; play with it for a few minutes, then think backwards to identify things you’re working with that they system is keeping track of.

|Term               |  Description
|-------------------|----------------------------------
|class	            |  A category of things that the system keeps track of 
| object            |	 Instances of classes   
| associations	    |  Relationship among instances of classes – only relationship that the systems keeps track of, those within the scope of the system             
| multiplicity      |  The number of instances of a relationship that instances of the class on either side of the relationship can be involved in    
| Multiplicity constraints |  Does having an instance of this relationship required for objects on either side?  Is there an upper limit to the number of instances of this relationship for objects on either side?              
| attributes	     |  A set of features that describe the class
                   |  Giving value to the attributes defines an instance of the class                
                   |  or an object
