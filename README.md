# Iteration 1: Domain Model Class Diagram
In this lab you practice create a first draft of domain model class diagram.
A domain model class diagram shows things that your system will track of in order to function.

You start by accessing: [AI](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai).
Pick Semantis or any other experiment; play with it for a few minutes, then think backwards to identify things you’re working with that they system is keeping track of.

|Term               |  Description
|-------------------|----------------------------------
|class	            |  A category of things that the system keeps track of 
| object            |	 Instances of classes   
| associations	    |  Relationship among instances of classes – only relationship that the systems keeps track of, those within the scope of the system             
| multiplicity      |  The number of instances of a relationship that instances of the class on either side of the relationship can be involved in    
| Multiplicity constraints |  Does having an instance of this relationship required for objects on either side?  Is there an upper limit to the number of instances of this relationship for objects on either side?              
| attributes	     |  A set of features that describe the class Giving value to the attributes defines an instance of the class or an object  
                
   
   
   
# Lab 2
# Concept Map Programming 
For today: use the [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
Recommendation for future: download and install Anaconda, use Spyder.
Pick 8-10 concepts that we have learned in the course so far. Connect them with links, labels links to
describe the nature of the connection.





# Lab 3 
# Iteration 1: Activity Diagram
In this lab you practice create a simple activity diagram.
An activity diagram shows the step required by the system (and modules inside it) to deliver a given feature to a group of actors.

Practice in class: start by creating a simple activity diagram for one of the Wolfram Alpha use cases that you have identified.

Then visit [Google Cloud IoT services](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot-overview)
Also, watch this video  for some ideas about 4 different ways of implementing the same features. There are many other resources on Google IoT you may want to explore, feel free to do some explorations.
Pick one IoT application feature and try your best to describe the steps according to your understanding of Google IoT platform. Later during the semester, you will be working on an IoT project, so this is a good time to start understanding the process. If you are familiar with any other IoT cloud platform (e.g., AWS or IBM’s) you can focus on those platforms. The purpose is to describe a simple IoT application’s feature using an activity diagram.
